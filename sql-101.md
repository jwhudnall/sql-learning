# SQL 101

## Database Creation
Steps to create databases, table, columns and more.

`CREATE DATABASE <db_name>` - Creates a new database with name `<db_name>`.
`USE <db_name>` - Tells the RDBMS to use the `<db_name>` database.

## Displaying & Creating Databases and Tables
### Creating a Database
* `SHOW DATABASES;` - Shows available Databases.
* `CREATE DATABASE db_name` - Creates a new Database named `db_name`.
* `USE <database_name>;` - Selects specified database for use.


### Creating a Table
* `CREATE TABLE drinks`  
 `(`    
	`drink_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,`  
	`main VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,`  
	`amount1 DEC(5,2) NOT NULL,`  
	`second VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,`  
	`amount2 DEC(5,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.00,`  
	`directions VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL`  
`);` - Creates new table within current database.

## Data
### Adding Data to a Table  
`INSERT INTO drinks`\
`(drink_name, main, amount1, second, amount2, directions)`\
`VALUES`\
`('Blackthorn', 'tonic water', 1.5, 'pineapple juice', 1, 'stir with ice, strain into cocktail glass with lemon twist');`\

**Note:** 
* Use "\\" or an additional ' if the data string contains an apostrophe.  
* Use single quotes ('). Stay away from double quotes so as not to interfere with programming language's manipulation of the databases.

## Searching a Table
* `SHOW TABLES;` - Shows available tables within current database.
* `SELECT * FROM drinks` - Selects all columns and rows from `drinks` table.
	* Columns are also referred to as *Fields*
	* Rows are also referred to as *Records*

### Refined Searches
`SELECT drink_name, main, second`\
`FROM drinks`\
`WHERE main = 'soda';`  
Only returns the 3 specified columns from the drinks table where the main ingredient is "soda."

**Note:** Selecting only specific columns is both **faster** and occupies less viewing space.
#### Comparison Operators
* `OR` can be used in a similar manner to limit query results.
* `=`, `<`, `>`, `>=` limit queries of numerical values.
* `<>` and `!=` represent *Not Equal To*.
* `IS NULL` returns records with null values in the specified fields.
	* ex: `SELECT * FROM drinks WHERE calories IS NULL`
* `LIKE` - Returns queries that include the following wildcard search.
	* `SELECT * FROM my_contacts WHERE location LIKE '%CA';` - Returns any records that end with "CA" (case insensitive)

Wildcards
* `%` - Represents any number of unknown characters.
* `_` - Represents a **single** unknown character

#### Other Keywords
* `BETWEEN` - Can be used in place of `<=` and `>=` symbols.
* `IN` or `NOT IN` - Used along with a set of values `(Value1, [Value2]..)`.
	* `..WHERE rating IN ('innovative','delightful')` # Returns records whose *rating* matches any of the values in the set.
* `NOT` - Negates the following statement logic. Can be used with `BETWEEN`, `LIKE` and other cases.
	* `NOT` goes right ***after*** `WHERE`. Ex: `..WHERE NOT carbs BETWEEN 3 AND 5;`

### DELETE and UPDATE
`DELETE` lets us **remove data**

* All records that match the WHERE condition will be deleted.
	* example: `DELETE FROM clown_info WHERE activities = 'dancing';`
* Cannot be used to delete values from columns.
* Can be used to delete single or multiple rows, depending on the condition clause.
* Can delete ***ALL*** rows from a table with `DELETE FROM table_name`
* It is good practice to use `SELECT` prior to `DELETE` with a given query. This verifies what will be deleted, avoiding mistakes.

####3-Step Delete Method
1. `SELECT` the record(s) to verify what will soon be deleted.
2. `INSERT` the new record.
3. `DELETE` the old record(s) using the same `WHERE` clause from step 1.

Example:
1. `SELECT * FROM clown_info WHERE activities = 'dancing';`
2. `INSERT INTO clown_info VALUES ('Zippo', 'Millstone Mall', 'F, orange suit', 'dancing, singing');`
3. `DELETE FROM clown_info WHERE activities = 'dancing';`

#### UPDATE
`UPDATE` lets us **change data**

`UPDATE doughnut_ratings`\
`SET`\
`type = 'glazed'`\
`WHERE type = 'plain glazed';`\
*Note: "type" is the name of a column. In this example, all "plain glazed" doughnuts are changed to "glazed"*
* `SET` - defines what the new value should be. Tells the RDBMS that it needs to change the column before the equal sign to contain the value after the equal sign.

**Update Rules:**
* You can update more than one columns by putting more `column = value` pairs to the SET clause, with a comma after each.
Example:
`UPDATE table`\
`SET first_col = 'newvalue'`\
`second_col = 'another_val'`
* `UPDATE` can update either a single or multiple rows, depending on the `WHERE` clause.
	* `UPDATE` replaces the `INSERT`/`DELETE` combination above.
